# USVG - Unity SVG to geometry Importer

## Overview
 
This plugin works is a custom asset importer, it allows you to import SVG files directly into the Unity project, converting them into simple geometry **Not texture!**

**Its Drag and drop!**

## Features
At the moment it supports basic SVG Shapes:
 * Rect (and rounded rect too)
 * Circle
 * Elipse
 * Line
 * Polyline
 * Path
 * Polygon

Supports Transformations, Fill.


## On the Way (TODO List)
 * Arcs (on Paths)
 * clipPath (in order to make it Adobe Illustrator compatible)
 * Strokes (now are parsed but no rendered)
 * Gradiends with shaders (maybe?)
